# Hello NUKit!

This folder contains a starter kit you can use to build your own application based on NUKit. It contains the basic skeleton of a standard NUKit app, as well as build scripts, Docker files, and a ready to use .gitmodules


## Get Started

First of all, initialize the git repository:

    git init .
    git submodule update --init

Then:

- Open and edit the `Jakefile` and enter your information.
- Open and edit the `Info.plit` and enter your information.
- Open the `index.html` and `index.html` and set the `<title></title>`

Your basic configuration is now ready.

> Note that at this stage, the application won't load.


## Start Coding

Open the `AppController.j` and start coding your application.

> Note that you'll need a working Garuda backend in order to try your application.


## Finally?

Erase the content of this file, and write your own `README` ;)
